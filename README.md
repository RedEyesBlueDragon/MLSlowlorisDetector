# Machine Learning Classifier for Detecting Slowloris Attacks from Wireshark Input

# Abstract
Slowloris is a type of distributed denial of
service (DDoS) attack that targets websites or servers by
sending them with incomplete HTTP requests to make
the server unresponsive. This paper proposes a machine
learning (ML) classifier for detecting Slowloris attacks.
The proposed classifier uses features that are extracted
from the TCP and HTTP packets captured by Wireshark
to train the model that can accurately identify Slowloris
attacks. The results of the training and real-life scenery
demonstrate that the proposed classifier can successfully
detect these attacks. The proposed classifier could be used
to create an effective tool to protect online services from
Slowloris attacks.
